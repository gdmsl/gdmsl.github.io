Hi, my name is **Guido Masella** and I am a 26yo physicists, coder and
GNU/Linux enthusiast.

# Physics

I am interested in Computational Physics, mainly many-body problems involving
ultra-cold atomic gases.

My main interests (in a completely random list of keywords):

* Simulations,
* Monte Carlo methods,
* Kinetic Monte Carlo,
* non-equilibrium dynamics,
* Rydberg atoms,
* BEC,
* Condensed Matter.

# Programming

Currently I work with a bunch of programming languages:

* C++14 (for writing simulations),
* C (reading others code),
* Fortran (a lot of libraries and simulation software out there are written
  in Fortran),
* Julia (for analysis and plotting),
* Python (for analysis and plotting),
* Bash & Zsh (for everything else).

# My current projects

* Searching for a **PhD position**.
* `johannes` and `rydbergs` - *private* libraries and drivers for fast and
  optimized KMC calculations on atomic systems with atoms excited to Rydberg's
  states.
* A [Genuino](http://arduino.cc) oscilloscope (stuck at searching for a good
  and cheap ADC).
* Learning [Rust](http://rust-lang.org)
* Mi lernas esperanto.
* Playing some DoTA2 as [BeagleWarlord](http://www.dotabuff.com/players/99087439)

# Aspirations

* Have a revolutionary algorithm in Physics named after myself,
* become as awesome as my parents,
* own an Intel® Xeon Phi™, or a nVidia Tesla K80 or both,
* own a nVidia GTX 980 Ti (maybe even two of them),
* become a pro DoTA2 player.
