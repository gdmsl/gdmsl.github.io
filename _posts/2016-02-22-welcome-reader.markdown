Hi reader! How are you? Welcome to my new and shiny *blog*!

I will try to keep you up to date because I have a lot of awesome stuff to
show you, and more will come with time. I have decided to post here weekly
about physics, scientific programming, and about my adventures in the world
of GNU/Linux (currently I live in the United States of [Archlinux][arch]).

So go on, continue to read my blog, subscribe to the rss feed and follow
me on [Twitter][twitter] or [Google+][gplus].
